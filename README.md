# yield_prediction_lstm_tcn_uet (2020-EE-61, 2020-EE-58, 2020-EE-174)
In this work, we propose a novel approach for greenhouse crop yield prediction by leveraging the capabilities of two state-of-the-art networks for temporal sequence processing: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN).
